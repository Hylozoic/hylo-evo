# Hylo Contribution Guide

## Why contribute to Hylo?

Hylo is a co-created and community-led platform. As an open-source project (as opposed to closed-source, proprietary technology), everyone is free to look at the codebase and add to it, and we don't charge people to use the platform. Hylo doesn't exist to maximize revenue for anyone. Instead, Hylo's purpose is to help groups organize impactful action.

Hylo relies on donations - of money, and of time and energy from people who share a vision for a world where our collective resources are shared as a commons. Our water, our land, and even our technology tools can be cooperatively stewarded by the community, for the benefit of all.

Do you dream of a world that works for all? If so, Hylo could benefit from your care. Here’s how to get involved.

## Our Culture & Design Principles
As the builders of a collaboration platform, we strive for helpful and respectful interactions. Our culture is kind and encouraging, and it’s important to us that the community creating Hylo is a safe and welcoming space for all.

These are the values we embed at every level of our stack. Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to learn more about how to move in this space.

### Seven-generation thinking
We are building tools for long-term planetary thriving; so that our children have clean air to breath and healthy food to eat.

### Relationship-centered design
We work in deep partnership with all stakeholders, optimizing for trust and relationship-building with every other community this work touches. We do this by prioritizing co-creative product and design sessions, sharing a transparent product journey, and inviting suggestions and engagement from all Hylo stakeholders to ensure we are building for real needs of real communities.

### Transparency
Hylo is open source and our operations, finances, and governance are open to all.

### Interoperability
We contribute to and create open standards and protocols wherever possible, and work to integrate with as many existing platforms as we can, especially those which are open source and values aligned.

### Privacy and User Sovereignty
Your data belongs to you, not us. We will never sell your data or share it without your explicit request. You can export and delete your data as you wish.

### Inclusivity
We are committed to ensuring these tools are shaped by and effectively serve diverse communities. Hylo will be accessible to all by remaining free to use in perpetuity. To support the development, we lean into the Gift and ask every stakeholder to contribute what they can.

### Collective Stewardship
Hylo is already developed by consensus among the Terran Collective stewards, and in deep partnership with our users. Eventually, Hylo will be stewarded by the community as a platform cooperative, where all users are stakeholders who may participate in the collective governance of the platform and receive abundance from its success.

If these resonate with you, we’d love for you to join the community of Hylo contributors.

## How to help
There are so many ways to contribute to Hylo, and we’d be delighted for you to participate in whatever way is most exciting to you! Of course, as a software project, we are always welcoming volunteer coders. But you don’t have to contribute code to be helpful! Regardless of your technical chops, there’s plenty to do.

### Here are some important ways to help out:
- Beta test new releases to ensure high quality functionality
- Create documentation, such as onboarding materials to help communities thrive on Hylo
- Submit feedback, bug reports, and feature requests
- Contribute code!

To get involved in beta testing, creating onboarding materials, or offering feedback on product ideas or designs, join [Building Hylo](https://www.hylo.com/groups/building-hylo/join/RcDe6vcG7u).

We accept bug reports through Intercom within the Hylo web application.

We accept [feature requests here](https://airtable.com/shrAWV0UkgDoM55TW). Follow along on our transparent [development roadmap here](https://airtable.com/shrcTCuwNDVTS1DpE).

## Developers
We are actively seeking developers to join our mission to amplify cooperation among people regenerating our communities and our planet. Our codebase is written in JavaScript and we use React/Redux/GraphQL on the front-end and Node + Postgres on the backend. To check out what we’re working on right now, head over to our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Hylozoic/projects/1) on Github.

### Our dev process
Hylo is stewarded by a team of engineers, designers, artists, and product managers from [Terran Collective](https://www.terran.io/). We create project scopes in partnership with organizations who use Hylo and have resources to share to help improve the platform for everyone. These project scopes guide us to set a timeline and assemble a team to carry out the development in co-creation with our partners. Right now, we meet weekly for collaborative sprint planning and backlog generation. We also like to pair program, and have deep dive product conversations. If you’d like to be a part of it, here’s what to do:

### Steps to get involved:
- Join the [Building Hylo](https://www.hylo.com/groups/building-hylo/join/RcDe6vcG7u) group, our open source community for people co-creating Hylo!

- If you get stuck, please reach out for support by sending Tibet a DM on Hylo

### How to make a pull request
- If it's your first time contributing to Hylo, please make a fork and PR from that fork.
