/*

Hylo Authentication and Authorization state reflected in terms of "Signup State"

  *Authentication*: We know who you are (you've validated your email)
  *Authorization*: You are allowed to access things

The state object and selectors below are primarily utilized for high-level routing
in `RootRouter`, `SignupRouter`, and `AuthRouter`.

Each state below below implies transition from the previous state has completed, e.g.:

  None > EmailValidation > Registration > SignupInProgress > Complete

*Some of this may be best consolidated into the `me` resolver, and/or `User` and
`Session` models, on the API side.*
