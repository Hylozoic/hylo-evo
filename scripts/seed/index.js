// Populate a development database with faked data using the same GraphQL the client uses.
//
// Motivation: our previous seed script... kind of worked, but quickly became out of date
// and had a number of edge cases where it didn't quite behave like the live data. This
// led to using client data in development, and staging, which isn't ideal from a privacy
// or security standpoint.
//
// The intent here is to provide something which uses the same function calls we use, so
// should continue to be relevant for longer. Likewise, we should not be afraid to throw
// away our previous development db, so that means we need something that is easy to
// recreate at the drop of the hat, and add to as we add more features.
//
// This is mostly just the launcher. Entities (networks, communities, users) are created
// using the named files in the `seeder` directory. These can be modified or extended as
// required. The seeder will run 'em all in the order specified.
