// The purpose of this reducer is to provide a general-purpose store for keeping
// track of the ordering of lists of data fetched from the API.
//
// For example, the Members component will want to track the order of Members
// to show when the sort order is set to "Name" separately from when it is set
// to "Location". And both of these lists are different from what should be
// shown when something has been typed into the search field.
