The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.0.3] - 2022-11-16

### Added
- `groupDescription` is now "autolinked" making external links added in the markdown clickable, including proper handling of Hylo links, mention, and topic links (via application of `ClickCatcher`)
- Terms and Privacy Policy links added to Signup page

### Fixed
- Styling of `groupDescription` to eliminate extra vertical space between paragraphs
- Back button behavior in the case of `LandingPage` > "About Us"
- Unexpected underline appearing in some links in mobile
- Sticking hover state color on MapExplorer buttons in mobile

### Changed
- Added default of `all` to `groupSlug` prop of `ClickCatcher`, doesn't change current behavior
- Removes now unused `navigation#removeGroupFromUrl`

## [5.0.2] - 2022-10-27

### Changed
- Navigating from one group to another no longer stays on the same view you were looking at (explore, map, member directory...) it instead always goes to the new group's home page which is the Stream. This is a response to feedback from many folks that it was confusing to change groups and stay on the same view.

### Fixed
- Bold text in a post now actually looks bold
- We now currectly show the current context in the navigation drawer

## [5.0.1] - 2022-10-24

### Added

- CustomViews of type 'post stream' can now specify a default view mode and sort but these can be changed by the user when looking at the Custom View.
- Add post stream search/filter feature. Click on the magnifying glass to enter a search term and filter any view of posts by that text.

### Changed

- BrowserList config changes to "default" (ref. https://github.com/Hylozoic/hylo-evo/pull/1258/files#r991717480)
- Patch and minor npm module dependency updates
- Topics stream and Projects view all use the same Stream component so they now have full Stream controls like sort and view mode
